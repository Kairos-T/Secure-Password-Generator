# secure-password-generator

This program uses Python to generate a random password that is made up of 16 characters chosen from a set of letters and numbers. It then encrypts the password using a secure encryption algorithm to keep it secret. Finally, it decrypts the password to show that the encryption and decryption process works correctly. This program can be used as a simple example of how cryptography can be used to keep data secure.
